This is a webscraper written in R to scrape the player and match data from Tracker.gg for the game Marvel Rivals. This is to be used for Data Analysis and Dashboards.

Since the API for tracker.gg cannot be accessed, I used RSelenium to open up a instance of Firefox and created a new browser.

The data scraped collects player data and match data. Additional data from individual matches can be obtained but not included in the code here.
