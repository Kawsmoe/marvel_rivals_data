This is a webscraper written in R to scrape the player and match data from Tracker.gg for the game Marvel Rivals.

Since the API for tracker.gg cannot be accessed, I used RSelenium to open up a instance of Firefox and created a new browser.

This was my first attempt at webscraping and using RSelenium.
